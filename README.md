# NodeAuthDemo

I have created a auth app which contains 2 pages i.e. /login, /signup.

In signup, user can register, on click of submit one OTP will be sent on the provided email address and the details will be saved inside database. Once it is verified, user will be redirected to the home page.

On Resend OTP, user will get a new OTP.

In login, user can login via registered credentials. On successful login, user will be redirected to /home and on failure, user will get an error message.

Technologies Used:

Backend: Node JS, Express JS
Database : Postgres
REpository: GitHub
Deployment Tool: Heroku
